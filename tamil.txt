Here is a simple C program to add two numbers:

Copy the code
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int num1, num2, sum;

    // Asking the user to input two integers
    printf("Enter two integers: ");
    scanf("%d %d", &num1, &num2);

    // Calculating the sum
    sum = num1 + num2;

    // Displaying the result
    printf("The sum of %d and %d is %d\n", num1, num2, sum);

    return 0;
}

How it works:
The program prompts the user to enter two integers.
It reads the input using scanf.
The sum is calculated using the + operator.
Finally, the result is displayed using printf.
